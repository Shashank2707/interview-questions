/**
 * Problem : 
 * 
 * Please help me with a solution
 * 
 * Stock Exchange The Challenge
 * 
 * Implement an order matching system for a stock exchange. 
 * Traders place Buy and Sell orders for a stock indicating the price and quantity. 
 * Each order gets entered into the exchangeâ€™s order-book and remains there until it is matched. 
 * Order matching is attempted whenever a new order is added.
 * The exchange follows a FirstInFirstOut Price-Time order-matching rule, which states that: 
 * "The first order in the order-book at a price level is the first order matched. 
 * All orders at the same price level are filled according to time priority." 
 * The exchange works like a market where lower selling prices and higher buying prices get priority.
 * 
 * A trade is executed when a buy price is greater than or equal to a sell price. 
 * The trade is recorded at the price of the sell order regardless of the price of the buy order.
 * 
 * Your program should take as input:
 * Order ID.
 * Time.
 * Stock.
 * Buy/Sell.
 * Price.
 * Quantity.
 * 
 * The output should be
 * Buy Order ID
 * Sell Price
 * Quantity
 * Sell Order ID
 * Input format: <buy/sell>
 * 
 * Output format:
 * SAMPLE INPUT-OUTPUT
 * 
 * INPUT:
 * #1 09:45 BAC sell 240.12 100
 * #2 09:46 BAC sell 237.45 90
 * #3 09:47 BAC buy 238.10 110
 * #4 09:48 BAC buy 237.80 10
 * #5 09:49 BAC buy 237.80 40
 * #6 09:50 BAC sell 236.00 50
 * 
 * OUTPUT:
 * #3 237.45 90 #2
 * #3 236.00 20 #6
 * #4 236.00 10 #6
 * #5 236.00 20 #6
 * 
 * Input needs to be read from a text file, and output should be printed to console. 
 * Your program should execute and take the location to the test file as parameter.
